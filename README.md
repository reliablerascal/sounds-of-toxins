# The Sounds of Toxins
_A sonifiction of Minnetonka, Minnesota's 10-day Air Quality Index (AQI) Forecast from 20 July 2023_

This project is an experiment in rendering data through sonification- specifically, translating AQI concern levels into musical chords.

My approach is based on the following presumptions:
<ol>
<li>The relative lack of published data sonification journalism, compared to data visualization, shouldn't necessarily suggest that it's an inherently limited form. Astronomer Matt Russo posits that its limited use is based in part on the present <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/6FgEpVFqtecHZS9Z0Sj8r0?si=6ReoipyKSDW0RpwXMFDpkw
" target="_blank">lack of formal instruction on how to interpret sonifications</a>.
<li>Sonification has some <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/6FgEpVFqtecHZS9Z0Sj8r0?si=6ReoipyKSDW0RpwXMFDpkw
" target="_blank">proven analytical use cases</a> and <a href="https://www.loudnumbers.net/" target="_blank">artistic uses</a> but might most effectively be tailored to convey data through eliciting an emotional response
<li>While existing data sonficiation techniques often rely on rhythm, tempo, and pitch of individual tones to convey data, a "time series" presentation of data could encourage passivity on the part of the listener. My personal conviction is that a <strong>single chord, by nature conveying all of its "information" in a single instant, is the best means for conveying data interactively</strong> via the harmonic tension between chord tones.
<li>Emotional response to music can be affected by <a href="Single chords convey distinct emotional qualities to both naÃ¯ve and expert listeners - Imre Lahdelma, Tuomas Eerola, 2016 " target="_blank">vertical harmony</a>, i.e. the relation between multiple notes played at the same time within a chord. Because different chords convey different levels of tension or stability, they might meaningfully be ranked as ordinal categories despite some intrinsic factors that might influence emotional connection.
</ol> 

Here's my story, [The Sounds of Toxins](https://reliablerascal.github.io/sounds-of-toxins/), as published on GitHub.

## Key Findings and Data Sources
This project focused on data expression, rather than data analysis. I simply acquired a ten day AQI forecast for Minnetonka, MN from aqiair.com. I chose this city because it ranked amongst the worst ten U.S. cities for air quality on July 24, 2023, AND showed signficant day-to-day variation in air quality.

<!---## Data sources
|Data Source|Description|
|---|---|
|[AllTrails](https://alltrails.com)|This free app allows you to create path maps or record them live based on live walking, and then export these maps as GPX files. Because I have no reliable means of controlling my walking pace, I chose to focus on created path maps rather than live walk maps. I excluded walk time as a variable.|
|[Google Earth](https://earth.google.com)|Regardless of whether I walked or recorded my map, AllTrails (and Strava) introduced errors in measuring the altitude of Riverside at sites of bridges over Trinity Cemetery(155th street) and Riverside Viaduct (136th to 129th Street). Google Earth allows lookup of actual height based on pointing and clicking on satellite images.|

## Overview of Data Interpretation Process
<!---Data Analysis Process--->
My data interpretation process involved the following general steps:
* Created a function to play chords using the <a href="https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/blob/dev/README.md" target="_blank">tone.js</a> Javascript library, based on a list of five notes per chord
* Created a series of six ranked chords to align with the six color-coded <a href="https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/" target="_blank">Air Quality Index categories</a> defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
* Reviewed these chords with classmates and teaching assistants in an attempt to establish something approaching objective ordinality of the chords.

## Data Quirks and Other E-Varmints Standing in My Righteous Path
My attempt to establish an <strong>agreed-upon ordinality of chord moods</strong> might have seemed successful, but an exception to the pattern needs further exploration. One listener, a formally trained musician who likes "shoegaze emo" music, rated a diminished chord as more agreeable than chords with less tension.

## What I Learned
This project is a very basic prototype for a concept I may like to explore further. Technically, I learned the following:
<ul>
<li>Developed a basic overview of the field of data sonification
<li>Learned about the tone.js library, which can play multiple notes simultaneously based on user-events
<li>Practiced use of D3 for non-visualization uses- namely, updating font size & style, text fields, colors, and sound events based on data read from a .csv file and reference to html classes. It's unlikely that D3 is the best tool for this job, but I simply wanted to gain practice using it.
</ul>

## What I'd Like to Learn Next to Advance this Project
Key to building off this project is soliciting and incorporating more user feedback. To help encourage this, I could do the following:
<ul>
<li>add different types of instrumentation to make this more fun/interesting
<li>add a user selector to switch city selection
<li>retrieve current data via API or web scraping to make this a "living" web page
<li>conduct more comprehensive research about existing chord-based data sonification projects
</ul>

## Guide to the Repository
Following is an overview of files in this repository:
<!---* [source_data](source/data/)- includes only my own manually-entered lookup table for CTA stations--->
<!---* [Jupyter Notebooks](notebooks)- six notebooks following through the data analysis steps from path development to calculating effort--->
* [data](data/)- this contains only a simple 10-day forecast acquired from [IQ Air](https://iqair.com)
* [scrollama_aqi.js](scrollama_aqi.js)- JavaScript code for responding to scrolling events, originally derived from https://github.com/zhoyoyo/lede23-animation. 
* [weather_chords.js](weather_chords.js)- JavaScript code for translating AQI readings to musical chords. This file specifies which chords were chosen to represent each AQI category- which I am not documenting here as it may be subject to change.
